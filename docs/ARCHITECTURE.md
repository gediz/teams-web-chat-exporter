```

Single-chat export runs go through `START_EXPORT`. Multi-chat bundle runs go through `START_BUNDLE_EXPORT`, which carries an array of conversation IDs and runs the per-chat scrape pipeline serially.

## Runtime flow

1. Popup sends `START_EXPORT` to background with `formats: OptionFormat[]` plus include/avatar/download/pdf flags.
2. Background checks tab context and injects the content script if needed.
3. Background asks the content script to scrape Teams (`SCRAPE_TEAMS`).
4. Content script tries API-based fetch first:
   - Reads MSAL tokens from localStorage (IC3, Skype, Graph). Handles MSAL Browser v4+ encrypted cache entries. Supports commercial and GCC High endpoints.
   - Discovers the chat service endpoint via the Teams authz API.
   - Fetches messages page by page from the chat service `/messages` endpoint (cap: `MAX_PAGES = 500` in `api-client.ts`, retries on 429 with exponential backoff + adaptive inter-page delay after page 20).
   - Resolves unknown user MRIs (forwarded senders, reactors) via Microsoft Graph when a Graph token is available.
   - Converts API response objects to ExportMessage format (`api-converter.ts`).
   - Fetches inline image/audio data from AMS URLs (max 5 MB per file, 6 concurrent fetches, retries 408/410/429/5xx with exponential backoff).
   - Fetches avatar photos via Microsoft Graph API when `embedAvatars` is on for a format that renders them.
5. If API fails at any step, content script falls back to DOM scroll mode:
   - Scrolls through the message list to load history.
   - Auto-clicks "See More" buttons on truncated messages and "Show hidden history" buttons when present.
   - Extracts messages from the DOM as they appear.
   - Deduplicates by message ID across scroll passes.
6. Content script streams results to background in chunks through a `chrome.runtime.Port` (port name prefix `scrape-result:`, 30-second connection safety timeout). Streaming avoids Chrome's 64 MiB single-message limit.
7. Background builds output based on the selected formats:
   - Single text format (JSON/CSV/HTML/TXT) → one file.
   - HTML + `downloadImages` OR HTML + `avatarMode: 'files'` + `embedAvatars` → `HTML.zip` with `images/` and/or `avatars/` folders.
   - PDF → `.pdf` produced by `src/background/pdf.ts` (pdf-lib + HarfBuzz subsets + Twemoji rasterization).
   - Multiple formats → `bundle.zip` containing each format side by side, with shared `images/` / `avatars/` folders when relevant.
8. After a successful download (or cancel) background appends a `HistoryEntry` to `chrome.storage.local` under `teamsExporterHistory` and honors `afterExport: 'show' | 'manual'` to auto-show the file in its folder.
9. Background sends progress/status updates back to popup via `EXPORT_STATUS` and forwards scrape progress as `EXPORT_PROGRESS`. The current `activeExports` map is mirrored to `teamsExporterActiveExports` in storage so a reopened popup can rehydrate its state without waiting for a message round-trip.

## Multi-chat bundle export

When the picker has 2+ conversations selected, the popup sends `START_BUNDLE_EXPORT` instead of `START_EXPORT`. The background handler runs the per-chat scrape pipeline serially:

1. For each conversation: `requestScrape` runs the same API/DOM logic as a single export, but `ScrapeOptions.noDomFallback = true` is set. This refuses the DOM fallback because DOM scroll always operates on whichever conversation is currently visible in the user's tab — almost never the target conversation in bundle mode.
2. The API client retries transient `403` and `5xx` responses on a tight budget — 3 attempts at 1s / 2s / 4s — before surfacing the failure (`fetchPageWithRetry` in `src/content/api-client.ts`). `429` keeps its existing 5-attempt policy.
3. Successful chats accumulate as `BundleEntry` records. Failed chats accumulate as `BundleFailure` records (folder name, conversation id, reason).
4. After the loop, the bundle is finalized:
   - Folder name collisions are deduped by `pickBundleFolderName` (appends `(2)`, `(3)`, …).
   - **All chats failed** (`entries.length === 0`): skip the .zip wrapper. `FAILURES.txt` is saved directly as `TeamsExport_bundle_<stamp>_FAILURES.txt`. The history entry uses `kind: 'failed'`.
   - **Otherwise**: the outer .zip is built by `buildAndDownloadBundlesZip`. Layout: `TeamsExport_bundle_<stamp>.zip/<chat-folder>/messages.{json,csv,html,txt,pdf}` + per-chat `images/` / `avatars/` folders + a top-level `FAILURES.txt` if any chat failed.

The outer zip pipeline uses `buildZipAsync` from `src/background/zip.ts`, which:

- Resolves a `Blob` constructed directly from the chunk array (no contiguous `Uint8Array` copy + no `new Blob([uint8])` step). For a multi-GB bundle this avoids doubling peak memory at finalize time, which previously caused "allocation size overflow" on Firefox MV2.
- Picks the per-file deflate level by extension: level 0 (store) for already-compressed inputs (`.zip`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.gz`, etc.), level 6 for everything else. Same final size as level-6-everywhere; ~3× faster on the outer-zip step.
- Yields to the event loop with `setTimeout(0)` between every file so the popup stays responsive during long zips.
- Routes through fflate's streaming `Zip` + `ZipDeflate` classes, never the higher-level `zip()` function. fflate's `zip()` spawns a Web Worker via `blob:` URLs, which Firefox extension CSP forbids.

## Key data types

- `Options`: user settings, stored in `chrome.storage.local` (`src/utils/options.ts`)
- `ExportMessage`: normalized message shape (`src/types/shared.ts`)
- `ScrapeOptions` / `BuildOptions`: scrape and output settings (`src/types/shared.ts`)

### Options fields

Authoritative definition: `Options` in `src/utils/options.ts`.

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| `lang` | `string?` |
| `startAt` / `endAt` | `string` (local input format) |
| `startAtISO` / `endAtISO` | `string` (ISO) |
| `exportTarget` | `'chat' \| 'team'` |
| `formats` | `OptionFormat[]` — non-empty; values from `'json' \| 'csv' \| 'html' \| 'txt' \| 'pdf'` |
| `includeReplies` | `boolean` |
| `includeReactions` | `boolean` |
| `includeSystem` | `boolean` |
| `embedAvatars` | `boolean` |
| `downloadImages` | `boolean` |
| `showHud` | `boolean` |
| `theme` | `'light' \| 'dark'` |
| `afterExport` | `'manual' \| 'show'` |
| `avatarMode` | `'inline' \| 'files'` (HTML only) |
| `pdfPageSize` | `'a4' \| 'letter'` |
| `pdfBodyFontSize` | `number` (clamped to `[8, 16]`) |
| `pdfShowPageNumbers` | `boolean` |
| `pdfIncludeAvatars` | `boolean` (per-format override) |
| `onboardingDismissed` | `boolean` |

Legacy storage with a singular `format` field is migrated into `formats: [format]` by `normalizeOptions` so existing installs keep their choice.

### ExportMessage fields

Authoritative definition: `ExportMessage` in `src/types/shared.ts`.

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| `id` | `string?` |
| `threadId` | `string \| null?` |
| `author` | `string?` |
| `timestamp` | `string?` |
| `text` | `string?` |
| `contentHtml` | `string?` (raw HTML, API mode only) |
| `messageType` | `string?` (e.g. `"Text"`, `"RichText/Html"`, `"Event/Call"`) |
| `edited` | `boolean?` |
| `system` | `boolean?` |
| `forwarded` | `ForwardContext?` (`originalAuthor`, `originalTimestamp`, `originalMessageId`, `originalThreadId`, `originalText`) |
| `importance` | `string?` (code checks for `"urgent"` and `"high"`) |
| `subject` | `string?` (channel post subject line) |
| `isOwn` | `boolean?` (author is the current Teams user — drives own-msg styling) |
| `avatar` | `string \| null?` |
| `avatarId` | `string?` |
| `avatarUrl` | `string?` |
| `reactions` | `Reaction[]` — `{ emoji, count, reactors?, self? }` |
| `attachments` | `Attachment[]` — `{ href?, label?, type?, size?, owner?, metaText?, dataUrl?, kind? }` |
| `tables` | `string[][][]` |
| `replyTo` | `ReplyContext \| null?` — `{ author, timestamp, text, id? }` |
| `mentions` | `Array<{ name, mri? }>` |
| `systemAttendees` | `string[]?` (participant names for call/meeting system messages) |
| `recordingDetails` | `RecordingDetails?` (populated for `RichText/Media_CallRecording`) |

## Status and persistence

- Background tracks active exports per tab in an in-memory `activeExports` map.
- Export-status phases the background emits as `EXPORT_STATUS`: `starting`, `scrape:start`, `scrape:complete`, `build`, `complete`, `empty`, `error`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`.
- Scrape-progress phases forwarded from the content script as `EXPORT_PROGRESS`: `api-fetch`, `scroll`, `extract`, `images`, `avatars`, `build`.
- Storage keys (all in `chrome.storage.local`, declared in `src/utils/options.ts`):
  - `teamsExporterOptions` — user settings.
  - `teamsExporterLastError` — most recent error, so the popup can recover context.
  - `teamsExporterHistory` — array of `HistoryEntry` for the History page.
  - `teamsExporterHistoryViewedAt` — timestamp used to compute the "new since last visit" count.
  - `teamsExporterLastPage` — `'main' | 'settings' | 'history'`, restored on popup reopen.
  - `teamsExporterActiveExports` — mirror of the background's `activeExports` map so the popup can rehydrate its export-button state on first render without waiting for the `GET_EXPORT_STATUS` round-trip.
  - `teamsExporterFirstInstalledAt` — install timestamp; gates the post-export rating prompt.
  - `teamsExporterReviewPrompt` — state of the rating prompt (dismissed / snoozed / etc).
  - `teamsExporterPickerFolder` — last selected folder filter in the conversation picker.
  - `teamsExporterPickerKind` — last selected kind filter (`'all' | 'chat' | 'group' | 'meeting' | 'channel'`).

## Supported Teams environments

- Commercial: `teams.microsoft.com`, `cloud.microsoft`, `teams.live.com`
- GCC High: `teams.microsoft.us`
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps proxy: `.mcas.ms` suffix on any of the above

Full pattern list is in `src/utils/teams-urls.ts`.

## Browser notes

- Chrome build target: MV3 output (`.output/chrome-mv3/`)
- Microsoft Edge build target: MV3 output (`.output/edge-mv3/`); same content as the Chrome build, separate artifact for Partner Center upload history.
- Firefox build target: MV2 output (`.output/firefox-mv2/`)
- Safari build target: MV2 output (`.output/safari-mv2/`); intended to be wrapped via Xcode's Safari Web Extension Converter for macOS / iOS App Store distribution.
- Background code uses `browser.action` when available, falls back to `browser.browserAction` (Firefox MV2).
- Download URL creation (`textToDownloadUrl`, `binaryToDownloadUrl` in `src/background/builders.ts`) uses `URL.createObjectURL` (blob URLs) when available. In Chrome MV3 service workers where blob URLs are not supported, it falls back to base64 data URLs.

## Large export behavior

- With API mode, exports are typically fast regardless of message count. DOM scroll mode is slower because Teams loads history progressively.
- In DOM scroll mode, scrolling stops when no new messages appear for several consecutive passes. Default thresholds: 12 passes without loading indicators, 20 with loading indicators. Team channel mode uses higher thresholds (30/35). If Teams stops loading older history, only what was loaded gets exported.
- Inline image/audio data can use significant memory for media-heavy chats. This data is streamed in chunks to avoid Chrome's 64 MiB single-message limit.
- For HTML exports, if total embedded data exceeds 5 MB or the export has 500+ messages with `downloadImages` enabled, the build pipeline auto-upgrades to ZIP output to avoid V8 string length limits.

## PDF specifics

- Fonts: bundled Noto Sans Regular/Bold/SC are shipped in `src/public/fonts/`. Before embedding, each font is subsetted at runtime with HarfBuzz (via `harfbuzzjs` + `hb-subset.wasm` loaded through `src/background/font-subset.ts`) to exactly the codepoints the document uses. The GSUB/GPOS/GDEF/kern tables are dropped from the subset so pdf-lib's per-codepoint drawing matches per-codepoint measurement (prevents the "confl uence"-style ligature gap).
- Emoji: Twemoji SVGs are vendored from `@twemoji/svg` at postinstall into `src/public/twemoji/`. The PDF builder rasterizes only the emoji actually used in the document and assembles them into a per-export PDF Type 3 font (see `src/background/pdf-type3-emoji.ts`). The font's ToUnicode CMap maps glyph codes back to Unicode codepoints (including multi-codepoint ZWJ sequences), so emoji in exported PDFs are selectable, searchable, and copy-pasteable as text. Firefox MV2 background takes an `<img>` + OffscreenCanvas path directly; Chrome / Edge MV3 service workers route through a `chrome.offscreen` document (`src/entrypoints/offscreen/`) because MV3 SWs lack DOM. Both paths share the same rasterizer in `src/utils/svg-rasterize.ts`.
- URLs: detected `http(s)` substrings in message body, reply quotes, forwarded bodies, and single-line attachment labels become PDF `/Annot /Link` annotations.

## Known quirks

- Content script injection in `background.ts` uses a hardcoded filename `content.js`. If WXT changes its output naming, this will break.
- In HTML.zip and bundle.zip exports, images and GIFs are extracted to the `images/` folder. Audio (voice messages) stays inline as base64 in the HTML file.
- Video attachments store the video URL in the `owner` field and the thumbnail URL in `href`. The HTML builder reads `owner` to render the video link.
- The active conversation ID comes from `tmp.session.<selfUuid>-mainWindowNavHistory[index].activeEntities.mainEntity.id` in sessionStorage on the Teams tab. Teams writes it synchronously on every sidebar click, so the lookup is locale-independent and has no DOM-race window. Returns null cleanly on non-chat views (Activity, Calendar, app landing). See `readActiveConversationId` in `src/content/teams-state.ts` and the full schema notes in [docs/TEAMS_INTERNALS.md](TEAMS_INTERNALS.md).
- The conversation list comes from Teams' own `Teams:conversation-manager:react-web-client:<tenant>:<userUuid>:<locale>` IndexedDB store, merged across every locale-suffixed variant Teams keeps in parallel. Folder definitions come from the matching `Teams:conversation-folder-manager` store. Both are read by `src/content/teams-state.ts` and assembled into picker rows by `src/content/api-client.ts`'s `listConversationsFromIdb`. The chat-service `/v1/users/ME/conversations` endpoint is no longer used as a list source — IDB has the full local set including meeting-derived chats and other niche product types the API omits, and stays consistent with what the user sees in the sidebar.
- Chat/channel context detection (`checkChatContext`) only matches `data-tid` attributes, never visible text — this is deliberate so non-English Teams UIs (French "Conversation", Japanese, etc.) work the same as English.
- Image fetching only allows Microsoft-owned domains (list in `src/content/attachments.ts`). Giphy GIF URLs from message content HTML are public and fetched without auth via the Giphy image parser in `src/content/api-converter.ts`.
